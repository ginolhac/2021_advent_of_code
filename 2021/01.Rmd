```

## Data


```{r}
d01 <- read_table("input/01", col_names = "depth")
```


### Part 1

```{r}
d01 |> 
  mutate(diff = lag(depth) - depth,
         increase = diff < 0) |> 
  count(increase)
```

- answer is 1154

### Part 2

```{r}
library(slider)
d01 |> 
  mutate(rs = slide_sum(depth, before = 0L, after = 2L),
         diff = lag(rs) - rs,
         increase = diff < 0) |> 
  count(increase)
```
