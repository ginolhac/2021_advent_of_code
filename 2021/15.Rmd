## Data


```{r}
input <- read_tsv("input/15", col_names = "x", col_types = "c", show_col_types = FALSE)
```


Solution from [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob/status/1471110669923667968/photo/1)

```{r}
grid_tidy(input, x)
```


```{r}
input |> 
  grid_graph(x, directed = TRUE, mutual = TRUE) |> 
  activate("edges") |> 
  # Add edge weights based on the destination
  mutate(weight = .N()$value[to]) -> chitons

# Distance from top-left (node1) to bottom right (node gorder(g))
igraph::distances(chitons, v = 1, to = igraph::gorder(chitons), mode = "out")
# 790
igraph::get.shortest.paths(chitons, 1, to = igraph::gorder(chitons))[[1]]
```

- Part2

```{r}
m <- grid_matrix(input, x)
wide <- do.call(cbind, map(0:4, ~ (m + . - 1) %% 9 + 1))
full <- do.call(rbind, map(0:4, ~ (wide + . - 1) %% 9 + 1))

part2 <- tibble(x = apply(full, 1, paste, collapse = ""))

part2 |> 
  grid_graph(x, directed = TRUE, mutual = TRUE) |> 
  activate("edges") |> 
  # Add edge weights based on the destination
  mutate(weight = .N()$value[to]) -> chitons2

# Distance from top-left (node1) to bottom right (node gorder(g))
igraph::distances(chitons2, v = 1, to = igraph::gorder(chitons2), mode = "out")
```
